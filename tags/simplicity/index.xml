      <description>&amp;ldquo;Hello Devs&amp;rdquo;  Career I&amp;rsquo;ve been a software developer since 2003 (16 years at the time of creating this site). Currently I work for a very large Fortune 50 company. During the course of that time I&amp;rsquo;ve been fortunate to gain a lot of experience in quite a few technologies.
Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing some Java Spring Boot API&amp;rsquo;s for some of our internal backend software. Prior to that I was working in a research area and got to build proof of concept ideas that showcased newer software, databases and cloud functionality.</description>
