	"content": " \u0026ldquo;Hello Devs\u0026rdquo;  Career I've been a software developer since 2003 (16 years at the time of creating this site). Currently I work for a very large Fortune 50 company. During the course of that time I've been fortunate to gain a lot of experience in quite a few technologies.\nLately I've been doing some Java Spring Boot API's for some of our internal backend software. Prior to that I was working in a research area and got to build proof of concept ideas that showcased newer software, databases and cloud functionality. I was also involved in creating continuous integration/continuous delivery automation primarily using GitlabCI, but I also have done quite a bit using Jenkins as well. Containerization has been another focus area for me for the last 3 years or so, and have Dockerized several dozen applications and databases.\nOn the UI front I've got experience with Angular, Vuejs, Nodejs, Material Design, Bootstrap, Webpack, etc etc.\nI like to play with software and hardware, and feel like I can teach myself just about anything. One of my driving motivations is to implement solutions that are user friendly and as simplistic as possible. I also believe in using the right tool for the job, doing things the right way.\nFamily I'm a happily married man with 4 wonderful children. I believe in family values and have strong morals and convictions. With that said we like to have fun, and I enjoy every precious moment and character flaws in all of them.\nHobbies  Building computers Linux Building Apps Sports Scotch Ancient History Cars Anything Do It Yourself Learning about stuff (I'm by no means a \u0026ldquo;know it all\u0026rdquo;)  "

	"content": "Welcome to my site  My name is Dave and I'm a Senior Full Stack Software Developer. I wanted to explore how Hugo works and at the same time learn the capabilities of this awesome Learn theme. Another reason I created this site to get a little more hands on experience with Github pages.\n Documentation One of the trends I keep seeing and promoting is the use of static generated sites for storing documentation. Hugo is the second one of these I've been using and am a big fan already. The other, which I like just as much, is Material for MkDocs.\nBoth of these static site generators are very easy to set up, configure and customize. The biggest benefit/trend I see is utilizing Markdown as the primary file type to document software. Some other benefits include search capabilities, automatic table of contents, ease and speed of deployment, and much much better consumability for developers\n"

I'm mainly using this guide, but my notes will be a scaled down version. Ubuntu also has a great tutorial here\nInstallation sudo apt install samba Verify Installation with: whereis samba\n Users and Groups We want to create a samba user and group and add our user to the group.\nYou can use the existing Ubuntu user as well. If you do not want to add a new user skip to the Create Group step. More information about users and groups can be found here\n Create User adduser will create the new user and prompt for a password\nsudo adduser smbuser Create Group sudo addgroup smbgroup Add our user to the group\nsudo usermod -aG smbgroup smbuser Set the samba password. Note this will be the password used when connecting from a remote device\nsudo smbpasswd -a smbuser  Set up and configure Samba Next we will create the directory we want to share on our network and configure Samba to serve it.\nDirectory sudo mkdir -p /home/smbuser/samba/share/ Set up the permissions\nsudo chown -R root:smbgroup /home/smbuser/samba/share sudo chmod -R 0770 /home/smbuser/samba/share Configure Samba Last but not least we need to configure Samba to share our directory we just created. There are lots of configurations available, but in this case we are just going to simplify the file.\nsudo nano /etc/samba/samba.conf Replace the contents with this\n[global] workgroup = WORKGROUP server string = Samba Server %v netbios name = \u0026lt;name of your machine\u0026gt; security = user [share] path = /home/smbuser/samba/share valid users = @smbgroup guest ok = no writable = yes browsable = yes Restart Samba\nsudo service smbd restart Check the config\ntestparm  Connect from another device At this point you should now be sharing a folder on your LAN. There are lots of ways to connect, the easiest is to use network discovery on the OS you are running. Another option is to manually type in the IP address. When prompted you will need to enter your user and password we created earlier.\n External Drive I had some issues getting the permissions set up right for an external hard drive. I fought with it over and over trying to get the permissions ot work right with chown and nautilus, but nothing would take. I ended up finding one answer on superuser that fixed the mount.\nStep 1 Open Disks and take note of the mount point for me it was /dev/sda1 mounted to /media/\u0026lt;user\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;ExternalDrive\u0026gt;\nStep 2 Unmount the drive in Disks selecting the external drive and pressing the stop button\nStep 3 Remount the drive using the appropriate permissions\nsudo mount -o uid=root,gid=smbgroup /dev/sda1 /media/\u0026lt;user\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;ExternalDrive\u0026gt;  Replace \u0026lt;user\u0026gt; with your ubuntu user and \u0026lt;ExternalDrive\u0026gt; with the name of your external drive.\n External hard drives can only be accessed by users with root access or mounted to the users directory. Ex: user1 cannot access an external samba share mounted to /media/user2/drive\n Editing fstab Danger, please know what your doing before proceeding\u0026hellip;see this guide\n For me setting the permissions and ntfs-3g options auto mounted my external hard drive how I wanted.\nUUID=FAEA8385EA833D3F /media/\u0026lt;user\u0026gt;/Seagate\\040Expansion\\040Drive ntfs-3g auto,users,uid=root,gid=smbgroup,locale=en_US.UTF-8 0 0 "

	"content": "I got a Raspberry Pi 4 recently to play around with on some home projects. I am going to try to see if its functional as a developer machine as well as run some dockerized apps on it. This post will document my experience and steps to get stuff up and running. Most of the documentation I do is essentially bread crumbs that I can later use to recreate something if I decide to blow it away and start over.\nChoosing an OS My first choice is to pick an OS. There aren't many available yet for PI4 so I'm starting with the officially supported Raspbian Buster Lite distro. I'm also going to try to install the Mate Desktop GUI on top of Raspbian. This guide talks about the steps you need to take to make it all work together.\nFirst Try I got the PI4 connected, booted up, and all was going well\u0026hellip;then I changed my password. Little did I know that changing the keyboard to US would end up bricking my OS. Because I used special characters in my password I got stuck on the terminal login with no way to get past it\u0026hellip;time to reload the OS\u0026hellip;fail #1\nManjaro I tried out manjaro and it was very nice on the PI. I was able to install some software, overclock the cpu and gpu, and try some stuff out. One quirk I found that led me to keep looking was the display resolution. For whatever reason it changed the monitor settings so that there was a border around the entire screen. I couldn't figure out how to get it to change back so I kept looking for other options.\nUbuntu Ultimately I'm going to try and set up a Ubuntu Server on the PI and use it to run some apps on my network, along with providing a local network share. Going to document the setup steps below.\nInstallation Hop on over to Ubuntu's Site to download the latest ISO for Raspberry PI4. Flash the microSD card using Balena Etcher. Once finished pop it into the PI4 and run through the installation, change passwords, etc. Finally install open-ssh.\nsudo apt install openssh-server I also want to install Wifi functionality so will do that as well\n?

	"content": "Over the last 3-4 years I've become more and more interested in nutrition and diet. My wakeup call was having blood analysis tests done and not having the best results. Up to that point in my life I never really cared that much about calories, salt, sugar or much of any type of food intake considerations. I would say my diet at the time was typical American and consisted of meats, cheese, chips, bread, and way too much sugar and salt. Like many Americans I also really enjoyed craft beer.\nChoosing a diet I've experimented with several diet options in the last few years. One of my main considerations is to choose something that is a lifestyle and not something that you try for 3-6 months and then fall back into old habits. The first one I tried was vegetarian, not because I don't like meat, but because I had read there are many additional benefits to the lifestyle. I will say that I learned a lot about what is healthy by trying to be vegetarian, but I think its really difficult to maintain that lifestyle in Midwest America. I learned so much and found so many different food choices by committing to a vegetarian lifestyle for almost a year, and I did manage to drop about 20 pounds.\nIntermittent Fasting During my journey to better health and fitness I ran across this video discussing Intermittent Fasting.\n  After seeing this I immediately began trying it and haven't looked back since. Everything about it just makes sense and is the exact simplistic diet that I was looking for. Since adopting intermittent fasting I've dropped an additional 20+ pounds and I can really notice a difference in body fat. I can't say enough good things about making this your daily lifestyle and highly recommend adopting it.\n What to eat\u0026hellip;    Nuts Fruit Vegetables Legumes/Rice Meats     Pistachios Apples Broccoli Rice Burgers   Almonds Bananas Carrots Black Beans Steak   Walnuts Blueberries Celery Black Eyed Peas Wild Salmon   Pecans Raspberries Cucumbers Kidney Beans Pork   Brazil Nuts Cherries Zucchini Lima Beans Chicken   Cashews Oranges Cauliflower Lentils Eggs   Macadamia Nuts Melons Asparagus Garbonzo Beans    Hazelnuts Strawberries Brussels Sprouts Chickpeas    Peanuts Grapefruit Spinach Peas     Pineapple Garlic Soy Beans     Avocado Kale      Pomegranate Green Peas      Mango Red Cabbage       What to Avoid\u0026hellip; The main thing to understand is that the 2 main ingredients in highly processed foods are Salt(sodium) and Sugar. These ingredients are used because 1) they preserve food so their shelf life is longer, and 2) They make food taste better. Get to know how to read nutrition labels and try to choose foods that are low in both salt and sugar.\n Salt and Sugar Processed Food  Canned Everything Crackers Chips Spaghetti Sauce Candy   Cheese  "

To activate it, simply add the file extension of the language you want to use directly after the first code \u0026ldquo;fence\u0026rdquo;, ```js, and syntax highlighting will automatically be applied in the rendered HTML. For example, to apply syntax highlighting to JavaScript code:\nRenders to:\ngrunt.initConfig({ assemble: { options: { assets: \u0026#39;docs/assets\u0026#39;, data: \u0026#39;src/data/*.{json,yml}\u0026#39;, helpers: \u0026#39;src/custom-helpers.js\u0026#39;, partials: [\u0026#39;src/partials/**/*.{hbs,md}\u0026#39;] }, pages: { options: { layout: \u0026#39;default.hbs\u0026#39; }, files: { \u0026#39;./\u0026#39;: [\u0026#39;src/templates/pages/index.hbs\u0026#39;] } } } }; Tables Tables are created by adding pipes as dividers between each cell, and by adding a line of dashes (also separated by bars) beneath the header. Note that the pipes do not need to be vertically aligned.\n| Option | Description | | ------ | ----------- | | data | path to data files to supply the data that will be passed into templates. | | engine | engine to be used for processing templates.

Links Basic link [Assemble](http://assemble.io) Renders to (hover over the link, there is no tooltip):\nAssemble\nHTML:\n\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;http://assemble.io\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Assemble\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; Add a title [Upstage](https://github.com/upstage/ \u0026#34;Visit Upstage!\u0026#34;) Renders to (hover over the link, there should be a tooltip):\nUpstage\nHTML:\n\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://github.com/upstage/\u0026#34; title=\u0026#34;Visit Upstage!\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Upstage\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; Named Anchors Named anchors enable you to jump to the specified anchor point on the same page. For example, each of these chapters:\n# Table of Contents * [Chapter 1](#chapter-1) * [Chapter 2](#chapter-2) * [Chapter 3](#chapter-3) will jump to these sections:\n## Chapter 1 \u0026lt;a id=\u0026#34;chapter-1\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; Content for chapter one. ## Chapter 2 \u0026lt;a id=\u0026#34;chapter-2\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; Content for chapter one. ## Chapter 3 \u0026lt;a id=\u0026#34;chapter-3\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; Content for chapter one. NOTE that specific placement of the anchor tag seems to be arbitrary. They are placed inline here since it seems to be unobtrusive, and it works.\nImages Images have a similar syntax to links but include a preceding exclamation point.\n![Minion](https://octodex.github.com/images/minion.png) or\n![Alt text](https://octodex.github.com/images/stormtroopocat.jpg \u0026#34;The Stormtroopocat\u0026#34;) Like links, Images also have a footnote style syntax\nAlternative usage : note images ![Alt text][id] With a reference later in the document defining the URL location:\n[id]: https://octodex.github.com/images/dojocat.jpg \u0026quot;The Dojocat\u0026quot;  Resizing image Add HTTP parameters width and/or height to the link image to resize the image. Values are CSS values (default is auto).\n![Minion](https://octodex.github.com/images/minion.png?width=20pc) ![Minion](https://octodex.github.com/images/minion.png?height=50px) ![Minion](https://octodex.github.com/images/minion.png?height=50px\u0026amp;width=300px) Add CSS classes Add a HTTP classes parameter to the link image to add CSS classes. shadowand border are available but you could define other ones.\n![stormtroopocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/stormtroopocat.jpg?classes=shadow) ![stormtroopocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/stormtroopocat.jpg?classes=border) ![stormtroopocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/stormtroopocat.jpg?classes=border,shadow) "
