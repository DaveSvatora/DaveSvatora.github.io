Currently I work for a very large Fortune 50 company. During the course of that time I've been fortunate to gain a lot of experience in quite a few technologies. Lately I've been doing some Java Spring Boot API's for some of our internal backend software. Prior to that I was working in a research area and got to build proof of concept ideas that showcased newer software, databases and cloud functionality. I was also involved in creating continuous integration/continuous delivery automation primarily using GitlabCI , but I also have done quite a bit using Jenkins as well. Containerization has been another focus area for me for the last 3 years or so, and have Dockerized several dozen applications and databases. On the UI front I've got experience with Angular , Vuejs , Nodejs , Material Design , Bootstrap , Webpack , etc etc. I like to play with software and hardware, and feel like I can teach myself just about anything. One of my driving motivations is to implement solutions that are user friendly and as simplistic as possible. I also believe in using the right tool for the job, doing things the right way.

My wakeup call was having blood analysis tests done and not having the best results. Up to that point in my life I never really cared that much about calories, salt, sugar or much of any type of food intake considerations. I would say my diet at the time was typical American and consisted of meats, cheese, chips, bread, and way too much sugar and salt. Like many Americans I also really enjoyed craft beer . Choosing a diet I've experimented with several diet options in the last few years. One of my main considerations is to choose something that is a lifestyle and not something that you try for 3-6 months and then fall back into old habits. The first one I tried was vegetarian , not because I don't like meat, but because I had read there are many additional benefits to the lifestyle. I will say that I learned a lot about what is healthy by trying to be vegetarian, but I think its really difficult to maintain that lifestyle in Midwest America. I learned so much and found so many different food choices by committing to a vegetarian lifestyle for almost a year, and I did manage to drop about 20 pounds. Intermittent Fasting During my journey to better health and fitness I ran across this video discussing Intermittent Fasting . After seeing this I immediately began trying it and haven't looked back since. Everything about it just makes sense and is the exact simplistic diet that I was looking for. Since adopting intermittent fasting I've dropped an additional 20+ pounds and I can really notice a difference in body fat.

I am going to try to see if its functional as a developer machine as well as run some dockerized apps on it. This post will document my experience and steps to get stuff up and running. Most of the documentation I do is essentially bread crumbs that I can later use to recreate something if I decide to blow it away and start over. Choosing an OS My first choice is to pick an OS. There aren't many available yet for PI4 so I'm starting with the officially supported Raspbian Buster Lite distro. I'm also going to try to install the Mate Desktop GUI on top of Raspbian. This guide talks about the steps you need to take to make it all work together. First Try I got the PI4 connected, booted up, and all was going well...then I changed my password. Little did I know that changing the keyboard to US would end up bricking my OS. Because I used special characters in my password I got stuck on the terminal login with no way to get past it...time to reload the OS...fail #1 Manjaro I tried out manjaro and it was very nice on the PI. I was able to install some software, overclock the cpu and gpu, and try some stuff out. One quirk I found that led me to keep looking was the display resolution. For whatever reason it changed the monitor settings so that there was a border around the entire screen. I couldn't figure out how to get it to change back so I kept looking for other options. Ubuntu Ultimately I'm going to try and set up a Ubuntu Server on the PI and use it to run some apps on my network, along with providing a local network share. Going to document the setup steps below. Installation Hop on over to Ubuntu's Site to download the latest ISO for Raspberry PI4 . Flash the microSD card using Balena Etcher . Once finished pop it into the PI4 and run through the installation, change passwords, etc. Finally install open-ssh. sudo apt install openssh-server Wireless First install wireless network-manager to use nmcli sudo apt install network-manager","title":"Pi4"},{"location":"computers_and_stuff/pi4/#choosing-an-os","text":"My first choice is to pick an OS.

Note that the pipes do not need to be vertically aligned. | Option | Description | | ------ | ----------- | | data | path to data files to supply the data that will be passed into templates. | | engine | engine to be used for processing templates.

Links Basic link [Assemble](http://assemble.io) Renders to (hover over the link, there is no tooltip): Assemble HTML: < a href = \"http://assemble.io\" > Assemble </ a > Add a title [Upstage](https://github.com/upstage/ \"Visit Upstage!\") Renders to (hover over the link, there should be a tooltip): Upstage HTML: < a href = \"https://github.com/upstage/\" title = \"Visit Upstage!\" > Upstage </ a > Named Anchors Named anchors enable you to jump to the specified anchor point on the same page. For example, each of these chapters: # Table of Contents * [Chapter 1](#chapter-1) * [Chapter 2](#chapter-2) * [Chapter 3](#chapter-3) will jump to these sections: ## Chapter 1 <a id=\"chapter-1\"></a> Content for chapter one. ## Chapter 2 <a id=\"chapter-2\"></a> Content for chapter one. ## Chapter 3 <a id=\"chapter-3\"></a> Content for chapter one. NOTE that specific placement of the anchor tag seems to be arbitrary. They are placed inline here since it seems to be unobtrusive, and it works. Images Images have a similar syntax to links but include a preceding exclamation point. ![Minion](https://octodex.github.com/images/minion.png) or ![Alt text](https://octodex.github.com/images/stormtroopocat.jpg \"The Stormtroopocat\") Like links, Images also have a footnote style syntax Alternative usage : note images ![Alt text][id] With a reference later in the document defining the URL location: [id]: https://octodex.github.com/images/dojocat.jpg \"The Dojocat\" Resizing image Add HTTP parameters width and/or height to the link image to resize the image.
